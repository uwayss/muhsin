# Muhsin's Privacy Promise

## The Short Version

Nothing leaves your device. The app doesn't access the internet. No one knows about your data except for you and Allah ü§ç.

## The Details

1.  **Everything Stays on Your Phone.** When you log a deed, it's saved to a private file on your device. That's it. It never goes to a server, because there are no servers.

2.  **No Accounts, No Tracking.** We don't want your email, your name, or anything else. The app is 100% anonymous. There are no analytics, no ads, and no trackers.

3.  **It Works Completely Offline.** You don't need an internet connection to use Muhsin. It's designed to be your private companion, not a data-collection tool.

4.  **Want to Check The Code? Go Ahead.** This app is fully open-source. You can read every line of code [right here on GitHub](https://github.com/uwayss/muhsin) to see for yourself that we stand by this promise.
