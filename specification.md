## 2.0 Screens & Features

### 2.1 Home Screen

The primary landing screen for the user.

  - After a deed is logged, its status is reflected on the right side of its row, with a background color and icon corresponding to the status (e.g., Green for Jamaah, Yellow for On Time).

### 2.2 Stats Screen

This screen provides an overview of the user's performance and consistency.

- **Deed Activity Graph:**
  - A grid-based visualization, similar to a GitHub contribution graph.
  - The Y-axis lists the user's main tracked deeds (e.g., the 5 daily prayers), represented by their icons.
  - The X-axis represents the selected time interval (e.g., days).
  - Each cell in the grid is colored to represent the completion state of that deed on that day.

  - A set of buttons or tabs that filters the data for the entire screen.
  - Options: `Weeks`, `Months`, `Years`, `All time`.

    - **In Jamaah** (Green)
    - **On time** (Yellow)
    - **Late** (Red)
    - **Not prayed** (Black/Dark Grey)
  - Each box contains the status title, the percentage, the total count (e.g., "27 times"), and a small visual bar chart.
- **Stats by Deed (Expandable View):**
  - An expandable list item, initially titled "Fard prayers" or similar.
  - When expanded, it reveals a detailed statistical breakdown for each individual deed.
  - Each deed shows a multi-colored progress bar visualizing the percentage breakdown of all its logged statuses (e.g., Fajr: 29% Jamaah, 43% On time, 28% Not prayed).
