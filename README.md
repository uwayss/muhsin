## The Story

This project began with a simple problem: a much-loved daily tracking application, used by many to maintain their spiritual habits, was abandoned by its original developer. Updates ceased, feedback channels went silent, and the user experience, while once effective, grew dated.

Rather than simply waiting for a replacement, this project is an answer. It's a ground-up effort to build not just a clone, but a spiritual successor. We aim to capture the essence of what made the original great—its simplicity and focus—while rebuilding it on a modern, robust, and open foundation.

### Our Philosophy

1.  **Privacy is Paramount:** Your spiritual journey is personal. The app operates entirely offline. There are no trackers, no analytics sending your data to the cloud, and no accounts to create. Your data stays on your device, period.
2.  **Open and Collaborative:** The entire project is open-source from day one. This ensures transparency and invites a community of developers to help build, maintain, and improve the tool for everyone's benefit.
3.  **User-Centric Design:** Every feature is designed with intention. The goal is to create a seamless, beautiful, and non-intrusive experience that aids, rather than distracts from, spiritual mindfulness.
4.  **Built to Last:** By using a modern, well-supported tech stack and adhering to clean code principles, we aim to create a stable and maintainable application that can serve the community for years to come.

This is more than a habit tracker; it's a tool designed to help cultivate _Ihsan_—excellence in faith and practice.
